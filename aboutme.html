    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Having patience is my main goal with me personal and professional life because I have noticed that I try to rush everything and when I do this I don't get the result I would like. I'll be working on this goal by refraining my issue every time I see a problem with something and taking a further look at it, and I'll also try to slow down when I feel like I'm rushing myself. The most valuable I'll consider for my success is accountability, this is important to me because I have to know when and how I made a mistake. Some short-term goals I hope to accomplish in the near future is improving my time being spent on an assignment so therefore I know whether my time being spent on an assignment is decreasing or increasing. Some characteristics I want to be known for is being a patient and time valuing person, who controls their attitude and mood.</p>
